# Capstone-Project
For this project, I build an online shop using HTML & CSS. the project is completely repsonsive, mobile view is visible under 768px, tablet view is visible under 992px and laptop/desktop is visible above 992px, there are 2 pages, the first one being the home page and the second being the search result page Which will open after clicking the search button. This HTML & CSS Capstone Project is based on an online shop for electronics. Following the desing of ZATTIX (by Mohammed Awad).
